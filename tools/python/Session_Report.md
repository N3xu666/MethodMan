# Session_Report.py

> Linux-only terminal session recorder that produces a MethodMan walkthrough
> draft in the section 3.2 format. Records in a clean `bash` subshell by
> default, so the transcript is readable regardless of your own shell config.

---

## Purpose

Record a live terminal session (Hack The Box, OSCP lab, or local practice)
and turn it into a structured walkthrough draft. The draft is written to a
per-session directory together with the raw transcript and a metadata file.

Use case: during a pentest or CTF session, run the recorder once at the
start, work normally in the subshell, exit when done. The result is a
`walkthrough-draft.md` with the MethodMan section 3.2 skeleton, ready to be
finished by hand (or by an AI assistant) into a full writeup.

---

## Quick start (standalone)

If you only want the tool and not the whole repository:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/tools && cd ~/tools
curl -fsSL -o Session_Report.py \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/N3xu666/MethodMan/main/tools/python/Session_Report.py
python3 Session_Report.py --version
```

The script is self-contained (standard library only). No `git clone`, no
`pip install`, no dependencies required.

To also fetch the documentation:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o Session_Report.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/N3xu666/MethodMan/main/tools/python/Session_Report.md
```

### Install as a Python package (optional)

The tool is also published as `methodman-session-report` and installs the
`session-report` command. This requires `pip` and (recommended on
Debian/Ubuntu/Kali where PEP 668 blocks system-wide installs) a virtual
environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/methodman
source ~/.venvs/methodman/bin/activate
pip install "git+https://github.com/N3xu666/MethodMan.git#subdirectory=tools/python"
session-report --version
```

Once installed, use the `session-report` command in place of
`python3 Session_Report.py`:

```bash
session-report start --machine Layover --target 10.10.11.10
```

This is entirely optional - the `curl` method above works without any
installation.

---

## Requirements

- **Linux only.** The recorder relies on `script(1)` from `util-linux`.
  macOS and Windows are not supported (macOS `script(1)` has different flags
  and no `-f`; Windows has no equivalent).
- **Python 3.9+** (uses `list[str]` in annotations, `datetime.timezone.utc`,
  `tempfile.mkstemp`, all available since 3.9).
- **`util-linux`** installed (`script` binary in `$PATH`).
  - Debian / Ubuntu: `sudo apt install util-linux`
  - Fedora / RHEL: `sudo dnf install util-linux`
  - Arch: `sudo pacman -S util-linux`
- **`/bin/bash`** for the default clean-shell mode (present on virtually
  every Linux distribution). If missing, the tool falls back to `/bin/sh`.
- Standard library only. No pip dependencies.

---

## How recording works

The tool starts `script(1)` with an explicit child command:

- **Default (`clean` mode):** `bash --noprofile --norc --rcfile <temp>` where
  `<temp>` is a minimal rc that sets a short `PS1` and disables PTY echo on
  the first prompt. Your own `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, oh-my-zsh, powerlevel10k,
  and syntax highlighting are **not** loaded. The transcript contains only
  commands and their output, with no prompt redraw noise.
- **`--raw-shell` mode:** your `$SHELL` with its own configs. Prompt redraws
  and color escapes end up in the transcript. The heuristic cleaner will
  strip the ANSI escapes, but zsh/fish/oh-my-zsh may leave residue. Use
  `--raw-shell` only if you specifically need your own environment (aliases,
  tab completion, custom prompt).

The chosen mode is recorded in `metadata.json` (field `shell`).

---

## Usage

### Record a session

```
python Session_Report.py start --machine <name> [--target <ip>]
                               [--language en|ru|az] [--output <dir>]
                               [--raw-shell]
```

### Rebuild a draft from an existing session

```
python Session_Report.py reclean <session_dir>
```

Use `reclean` after upgrading the tool to regenerate `walkthrough-draft.md`
from the saved `raw.txt` without re-recording the session.

### Arguments (start)

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--machine` | yes | - | Machine name (e.g. `Layover`). Used for the session directory name. |
| `--target` | no | empty | Target IP or hostname. Stored in metadata and in the draft. |
| `--language` | no | `en` | Walkthrough language. One of `en`, `ru`, `az`. |
| `--output` | no | `sessions` | Output root directory. Created if missing. |
| `--raw-shell` | no | off | Record in your own `$SHELL` with its user configs. |

### Example (default, clean shell)

```
$ python Session_Report.py start --machine Layover --target 10.10.11.10 --language en
[Session_Report] Session directory: /home/op/MethodMan/sessions/Layover-20261012T143012Z
[Session_Report] Metadata:          /home/op/MethodMan/sessions/Layover-20261012T143012Z/metadata.json
[Session_Report] Draft:             /home/op/MethodMan/sessions/Layover-20261012T143012Z/walkthrough-draft.md
[Session_Report] Shell:             /bin/bash --noprofile --norc (clean, no user configs)
[Session_Report] Cleaner:           heuristic
[Session_Report] Starting script(1). Type 'exit' to stop recording.

$ nmap -p- --min-rate 5000 10.10.11.10
...
$ exit

[Session_Report] Transcript cleaned: 8432 -> 6211 bytes.
[Session_Report] Final draft: /home/op/MethodMan/sessions/Layover-20261012T143012Z/walkthrough-draft.md
```

## Output layout

```
sessions/
+-- <machine>-<UTC timestamp>/
    +-- metadata.json          # machine, target, started, host, operator, language, shell
    +-- raw.txt                # raw script(1) output
    +-- walkthrough-draft.md   # cleaned draft in MethodMan section 3.2 format
```

`raw.txt` is kept for reference. The `.md` draft is the cleaned version with
the AI prompt block, the walkthrough skeleton, and the raw transcript
appended under `## Raw Transcript`.

**Note:** `sessions/` is listed in `.gitignore`. Drafts are local-only until
you decide to publish them (after masking, per section 3).

---

## Transcript cleanup

Cleanup runs on the raw `script(1)` output before appending to the `.md`.
The cleaner is stdlib-only and tailored for the clean-shell mode.

Steps:

1. **ANSI escape sequences** stripped (CSI, OSC, two-character escapes).
   Removes color codes, bracketed-paste toggles (`ESC[?2004h/l`),
   reverse-video echo (`ESC[7m`, `ESC[27m`), cursor moves
   (`ESC[A`, `ESC[B`, `ESC[C`, `ESC[D`), and erase-to-end (`ESC[K`).
2. **`script(1)` banner** lines removed.
3. **Line endings** normalized: `\r\n` and lone `\r` -> `\n`.
4. **Whitespace-only lines** converted to empty lines, trailing
   whitespace stripped.
5. **Prompt duplicates dropped.** Bash prints the full input block before
   executing, so each command appears twice after ANSI stripping: once as
   `bash-5.3$ cmd` and once as plain `cmd`. The cleaner drops the prompt
   version when the plain version appears later.
6. **Adjacent duplicate lines collapsed.**
7. **Blank runs collapsed**: 3+ consecutive newlines -> 2.

Result: a readable transcript with commands and their real output, no
shell prompt noise.

### Rebuild an existing draft

```
python Session_Report.py reclean sessions/Layover-20261012T143012Z
```

Reads `metadata.json` and `raw.txt` from the session directory, regenerates
`walkthrough-draft.md` from the header down. The existing `.md` is
overwritten.

---

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Session recorded / recleaned successfully. |
| 1 | Runtime failure (e.g. `script(1)` failed to launch, `raw.txt` missing). |
| 2 | Platform check failed: not Linux, or `script(1)` not found in `$PATH`. |

---

## Safety

- **No keylogger.** The tool does not read `/dev/input/event*`, does not hook
  the kernel, does not intercept syscalls. It only invokes `script(1)` in a
  child process, exactly as a user would run it manually.
- **No network.** The recorder is fully offline.
- **No telemetry.** The tool does not phone home, does not write outside the
  chosen output directory.

See `../../SECURITY.md` for the project-wide policy on authorized use.

---

## Limitations

- **Linux only.** See Requirements.
- **Single terminal.** One invocation = one recording session. Multiple
  parallel terminals are not merged.
- **Default mode has no shell conveniences.** No aliases, no tab completion,
  no `~/.bashrc`. This is intentional: the walkthrough should show the raw
  commands. If you need your usual environment, use `--raw-shell`.
- **`--raw-shell` may leave residue.** zsh/fish/oh-my-zsh emit cursor-move
  and redraw sequences that a regex cleaner cannot fully resolve. The
  transcript will be readable but may contain extra blank lines or repeated
  prompt fragments.
- **No masking.** Real secrets (flags, passwords, hashes) are captured as-is.
  Mask them manually before publishing, per section 3 of `_WORKFLOW.md`.

## Recording multi-window sessions

### The problem

`Session_Report.py` records **one terminal**. `script(1)` captures a single
pty and cannot see what happens in another window. In a typical HTB or
OSCP session you almost always need a second window (a `nc` listener, a
`python -m http.server`, Metasploit, a reverse-shell catcher). Only the
window where `session-report start` was launched ends up in `raw.txt`.

There is no perfect solution: every approach either changes your habits,
is invasive, or captures only part of the work. Pick the option that fits
your workflow.

### Option A - tmux (recommended)

Work inside a single `tmux` session. All windows and panes share one pty,
so `script(1)` sees everything.

```bash
tmux new -s htb
# inside tmux, in the first pane:
session-report start --machine Foo --target 10.10.11.10

# create more windows / panes:
#   Ctrl+b c   new window
#   Ctrl+b %   split vertically
#   Ctrl+b "   split horizontally
#   Ctrl+b n   next window
#   Ctrl+b p   previous window
#   Ctrl+b d   detach (session keeps running)

# when done: exit each shell; the tmux session ends and the draft is ready
```

Pros:

- One recording covers every window and pane.
- Nothing is added to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.
- Explicit start and end.
- Works with `nc`, Metasploit, `ssh`, reverse shells - everything.

Cons:

- You must work inside `tmux` (`Ctrl+b` prefix).
- Mouse support is off by default; enable with `set -g mouse on` in
  `~/.tmux.conf` if you want scrolling and copy-paste to work as usual.

### Option B - one session per window, merge manually

Start a separate recorder in each window that matters:

```bash
# window 1 (the main work)
session-report start --machine Foo --target 10.10.11.10

# window 2 (the listener)
session-report start --machine Foo-listener
```

At the end you have two independent session directories. Open both drafts
and copy the relevant lines from the listener draft into the main draft
under `## Foothold` or `## Privilege Escalation`.

Pros:

- No `tmux` required.
- Everything is captured - just in separate files.

Cons:

- You must remember to run `session-report start` in every new window.
- Manual merge at the end.

### Option C - shell hook that auto-starts script (not recommended)

A hook in `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc` can start `script` automatically in
every new interactive shell while a flag file exists. This gives the
closest experience to "work as usual and forget about recording".
However, it is **not implemented** in the current version of
`Session_Report.py` and is documented here only so you understand the
trade-offs before asking for it.

Pros:

- The closest thing to "no change in habits".

Cons:

- Invasive: it modifies `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc`.
- Invisible recording: you do not see that it is running; a mistyped
  password or token ends up in a log file.
- Breaks in subtle ways with nested pty: `ssh`, `docker exec`,
  `sudo su -`, `screen`, `tmux`.
- `session-report stop` cannot reliably flush sessions that are still
  open; either the user closes every window manually or the tool kills
  them, losing buffered output.
- Logs are not masked. Every command typed in every shell is recorded.

### Recommendation

Use **Option A (tmux)** for any session where a second window is likely.
It is the cleanest available approach. If you have never used `tmux`,
treat it as a 10-minute investment. The four keys you need are
`Ctrl+b c` (new window), `Ctrl+b %` (vertical split),
`Ctrl+b n` / `Ctrl+b p` (switch windows), and `Ctrl+b d` (detach).

If you cannot use `tmux`, use **Option B** and accept the manual merge.

**Do not use Option C** unless you fully understand the trade-offs;
it is not implemented in the current version.

## Tests

CI runs `python -m py_compile tools/python/Session_Report.py` to catch
syntax errors. Full functional tests require a Linux environment and are
not part of the CI matrix.

To run a smoke test locally on Linux:

```
$ python Session_Report.py --version
Session_Report.py 0.6.0

$ python Session_Report.py start --machine Test --target 127.0.0.1
# ... type a few commands, then 'exit'
$ ls sessions/Test-*/
metadata.json  raw.txt  walkthrough-draft.md
```
