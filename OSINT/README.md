# OSINT

Open-source intelligence reference: how to collect, verify, and analyze
publicly available information about people, organizations, and infrastructure,
and how defenders limit what can be discovered about them.

This category is written in the **two-track** format (Offensive / Defensive),
with an additional section `## Pentest and Red Team Application` in every file
that ties the technique to authorized offensive engagements.

> Authorized use only. All material is provided for educational purposes and authorized testing.<br>`n> See [../SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for the full policy.
## Scope

- OSINT methodology: collection planning, source evaluation, verification.
- People search: identity resolution, social media, public records.
- Infrastructure OSINT: domains, certificates, DNS, cloud assets, Shodan/Censys.
- Social media and content: platform-specific collection, geolocation, media forensics.
- Corporate and business OSINT: corporate registries, filings, employee mapping, supply chain.

## Subcategories

| # | Subcategory | Files | Focus |
|---|-------------|-------|-------|
| 01 | [OSINT Methodology](./01%20OSINT%20Methodology/) | 4 | Collection planning, source evaluation, verification |
| 02 | [People Search](./02%20People%20Search/) | 4 | Identity resolution, social media, public records |
| 03 | [Infrastructure OSINT](./03%20Infrastructure%20OSINT/) | 0 | Domains, certificates, DNS, cloud assets, Shodan/Censys |
| 04 | [Social Media and Content](./04%20Social%20Media%20and%20Content/) | 0 | Platform-specific collection, geolocation, media forensics |
| 05 | [Corporate and Business OSINT](./05%20Corporate%20and%20Business%20OSINT/) | 0 | Corporate registries, filings, employee mapping, supply chain |

## Format

Files in this category follow the two-track skeleton plus one
OSINT-specific section:

```text
## 1. Overview
## 2. Reconnaissance / Collection
## 3. Common Attack Vectors
## 4. Exploitation Recipes
## 5. Post-Exploitation
## 6. Preventive Controls
## 7. Detection Controls
## 8. Verification
## 9. Pentest and Red Team Application
## 10. Legal and Ethical Notes
## 11. Production Notes
## 12. References
```

The Offensive track covers sections 2-5 (collection through
post-exploitation). The Defensive track covers sections 6-8
(preventive controls, detection, verification). Section 9 ties the
technique to authorized offensive engagements. Section 10 covers
jurisdiction, consent, and legal boundaries - OSCP does not cover
OSINT, so the exam-notes section is replaced by legal notes.

## Authorized Use Only

The techniques in this category are for authorized security testing,
CTF environments, and educational purposes only. Do not use them against
people or systems you do not own or have explicit written permission to
investigate. OSINT collection about individuals may be subject to privacy
law in your jurisdiction (GDPR, CCPA, and others). See SECURITY.md in the
