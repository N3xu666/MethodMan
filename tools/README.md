# Tools

Custom penetration testing tools used across the MethodMan walkthroughs,
methodologies, and OSCP preparation. Written in **Python**, **Go**, and **Bash**.

These are **not** replacements for established tools (nmap, feroxbuster,
linpeas, etc.). They are small wrappers, parsers, and automation scripts
built for specific phases of the workflow.

> - CTF environments (Hack The Box, OSCP labs, TryHackMe, etc.)
> - Personal lab environments you own or are authorized to test
> - Educational study and research
>
> **Do NOT use these tools against systems you do not own or have explicit
