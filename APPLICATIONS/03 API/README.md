# API Security Reference

API attack surface: authentication, authorization, rate limiting, gateway controls, and the protocols that carry them. This category covers the API layer separately from general web application security - the threat model is different (no browser, no session cookies by default, machine clients).

Two-track format: every file has a Pentest track (detection, payloads, exploitation recipes) and an AppSec track (risk context, root causes, preventive and detection controls, verification). See the parent README for the format.

Writeups and references in this category are written in English only. The trilingual scheme (Az/En/Ru) applies to WRITEUPS only.

## Relationship to 01 Web

The `01 Web/` category covers the browser-facing layer: HTML forms, cookies, CSRF, XSS, CMS, servers, frameworks. `03 API/` covers the machine-facing layer: no browser, tokens instead of cookies, JSON/Protobuf instead of HTML.

Overlap exists in the underlying primitives (injection, authn, authz) but the detection and exploitation techniques are different enough to warrant a separate track. Cross-references point to `01 Web/` where the primitive is the same.

## OSCP Relevance

For OSCP, the API layer rarely appears as a standalone target. It appears as:

- A REST endpoint on a web app (IDOR for another user's data).
- A GraphQL endpoint exposing a mutation that bypasses the UI.
- A WebSocket connection with no origin check (CSWSH -> admin action).

The exploitation recipes in these files are written to be usable in a lab environment where the target is a live API, not just a theory read.
