![MethodMan - trilingual HTB writeups, web application security reference, methodology and tools](./social-preview.png)

New HTB machines are added as they are completed (retired only - see the stub scheme below for active machines). Reference material grows in parallel: the Application Security Reference (`APPLICATIONS/`), the Infrastructure Security Reference (`INFRASTRUCTURE/`), the AI Security Reference (`AI/`), the Anonymity, Privacy and OpSec Reference (`ANONYMITY-PRIVACY-OPSEC/`), the Network Security Reference (`NETWORKS/`), the Cloud Security Reference (`CLOUD/`), methodology notes, cheatsheets, and custom tooling (`tools/`).

Writeups available in Az/En/Ru. Currently: **17 published (retired) + 3 active stubs** = **20 completed machines**.

> The `(Now: M machines)` counter counts **only published walkthroughs** (machines retired on Hack The Box). Writeups for active machines are withheld per HTB ToS and stored as stubs (`Status: Completed`) until retirement.

> [!NOTE]
> All flags, passwords, hashes, and session tokens have been masked for ethical reasons.

### Other Resources

Reference material and tooling, independent of any single HTB machine:

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|

| [Network Security Reference](./NETWORKS/) | Network fundamentals, routing and switching, network devices, network protocols, traffic analysis and forensics, SDN and modern networks. Two-track format (offensive + defensive) across 6 subcategories (28 files). |
| [Cloud Security Reference](./CLOUD/) | AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes in the cloud, serverless, and infrastructure as code. Two-track format (offensive + defensive) across 6 subcategories (28 files). |
| [METHODOLOGY.md](./METHODOLOGY.md) | Engagement phases, intensity profiles, checklists. |
| [CHEATSHEET.md](./CHEATSHEET.md) | Quick command reference for common tools and techniques. |

| [tools/](./tools/) | Custom pentest tools (Python, Go, Bash). First tool: `Session_Report.py` - terminal session recorder. |

**Note:** files marked with `Status: Completed` are **stubs** for machines still active on HTB. Full writeups are published after retirement.

## Quality & Automation

Validation is split across three independent layers:

- **Pre-commit hook (`check.ps1`)** - LOCAL only, opt-in. Lives in `.git/hooks/pre-commit`, which is not tracked by git (git does not clone hooks). To install, add a one-line invocation of `check.ps1` to `.git/hooks/pre-commit` and make it executable. Fast (17 checks, ~2 seconds).

  **Blocking errors (commit is refused):**
  - real 32-hex flags,
  - leaks from the local masking dictionary,
  - missing ethical note in a walkthrough,
  - long dashes, broken UTF-8 chars, masking artifacts,
  - unreplaced placeholder markers in docs,
  - backslash-escaped Markdown in docs,
  - chat citation markers `[citation:N]`.

  **Advisory warnings (commit is allowed):**
  - heuristic suspicious passwords,
  - Exploitation section without a CVE reference,
  - broken relative links in docs,
  - counter drift in root README,
  - CVE table rows without a version range,
  - non-etalon References format (markdown-style links or colon-separated URLs instead of the `description - url` etalon).
- **Manual audit (`audit.ps1`)** - LOCAL only, run by the operator before important pushes. Covers git state, tracked files, walkthrough structure, Attack Chain, note placement, flags, dict leaks, dashes, encoding, placeholders, documentation, scripts, hook, origin sync, dynamic machine count, language-pair verification. The full audit is local-only; CI runs `audit.ps1 -SkipLocalChecks` as an informational job.
- **CI (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`)** - runs 8 jobs on every push to any branch and on PRs to `main` (pinned actions, read-only permissions):
  - `check` (windows-latest) - `check.ps1` with a placeholder `masking-dict.ps1` (the real dict is not in git).
  - `test` (windows-latest) - `tests/run-tests.ps1` (masking + check.ps1 leak tests).
  - `tools-syntax` (ubuntu-latest) - `python -m py_compile` on every `.py` under `tools/`.
  - `tools-tests` (ubuntu-latest) - pytest suite in `tools/python/tests/` plus a pip-install smoke test of the `methodman-session-report` package.
  - `gitleaks` (ubuntu-latest) - secret scan over full history with a custom 32-hex flag rule (`.gitleaks.toml`); blocking.
  - `audit` (windows-latest) - `audit.ps1 -SkipLocalChecks` (informational, non-blocking).
  - `anchors` (windows-latest) - `check-anchors.ps1` (informational, non-blocking).
  - `tables` (windows-latest) - `check-tables.ps1` (informational, non-blocking).

The masking pipeline (`mask.ps1` + a local-only `masking-dict.ps1` with known sensitive values) detects and masks flags (32-hex pattern), values listed in the dictionary, and heuristic password shapes. Detection is dictionary- and pattern-based, not exhaustive - manual review remains part of the workflow.

## Conventions

- **`01 Az/`** - Azerbaijani writeups.
- **`02 En/`** - English writeups.
- **`03 Ru/`** - Russian writeups.
- Each writeup follows a unified structure: Attack Chain (tree) -> Machine Briefing -> Reconnaissance -> Foothold -> [Authenticated Enumeration (AD only)] -> [Exploitation] -> Lateral Movement -> Privilege Escalation -> Flags -> Key Takeaways. Exploitation sections carry a CVE reference (NVD/MITRE link or "No CVE"); key commands show expected output; OSCP machines include screenshot reminders (`> [!IMPORTANT]`).
- All sensitive data (flags, passwords, hashes) is masked.
- Machines still active on HTB are represented by **stubs** (`Status: Completed`, neutral filename). Full writeups are published after retirement.
